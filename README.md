# Benchmark-for-MEET
A Simple Benchmark for Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing Scene Classification on the MEET Dataset.

## A Brief Introduction to the MEET Dataset
The MEET (Million-scale finE-grained geospatial scEne classification dataseT) is a state-of-the-art, large-scale dataset designed for remote sensing scene classification. As one of the most comprehensive datasets in this domain, MEET comprises over 1.03 million high-resolution, unscaled remote sensing images spanning 80 fine-grained geospatial scene categories. A visual summary of the dataset is presented in Figure 1.

What distinguishes MEET from previous remote sensing scene classification datasets is its innovative "scene-in-scene" layout. Each image features a central scene (highlighted in red) that serves as the primary classification reference, while auxiliary scenes (outlined in green) provide valuable contextual information. This unique structure enhances the datasetâ€™s ability to support fine-grained classification and contextual scene understanding.
